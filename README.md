# Inventory Store App

This Python project creates an inventory management system for a retail store using a dictionary-based approach. The system enables tracking and managing store inventory with functionalities to add, update, and remove items. The inventory is represented as a dictionary, where keys represent unique item IDs or product names, and values contain item-specific information like quantity, price, and description.
